// Write a program for a matchstick game being played between the
// computer and a user. Your program should ensure that the
// computer always wins. Rules for the game are as follows:
// − There are 21 matchsticks.
// − The computer asks the player to pick 1, 2, 3, or 4 matchsticks.
// − After the person picks, the computer does its picking.
// − Whoever is forced to pick up the last matchstick loses the game.
